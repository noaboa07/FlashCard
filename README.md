# Flashcard - A Personalized Learning Tool

**Flashcard** is an intuitive study app designed to help users enhance their learning experience through interactive flashcards. With seamless navigation and dynamic color changes (green for correct, red for incorrect), this app provides a fun and engaging way to review material. Users can create their own flashcards, toggle between the question and answer text, and even reset the deck to focus on more challenging cards. Whether you're studying for exams or mastering new skills, Flashcard makes learning more effective and enjoyable.

- Developer: Noah Russell
- Development Time: Approximately 3 hours
- Technologies Used: Swift, SwiftUI, Xcode

## Features

The following required features have been successfully implemented:

- [‚úÖ] Flashcard Navigation: Users can view a flashcard and toggle between the card's question and answer text with a simple tap.
- [‚úÖ] Swipe Navigation: Users can swipe left or right to progress through the deck, with color changes reflecting the user's choices (green for correct, red for incorrect).
- [‚úÖ] Reset Deck: Users can reset the entire deck or focus only on the cards marked for more practice.
- [‚úÖ] Create New Flashcards: Users can create and add new flashcards to the deck, making the app customizable to individual learning needs.

## Optional Features

The following optional features were planned but not yet implemented:

- [‚ùå] Save Cards Across Sessions: Persisting flashcards across app launches to allow users to maintain their deck over time.
- [‚ùå] Delete Cards: Functionality to remove cards from the deck.

## Future Enhancements

The app can be expanded with additional features such as:

- [üî≤] Card Persistence: Save flashcards across sessions and restore them upon app launch.
- [üî≤] Card Deletion: Add the ability to delete flashcards from the deck.
- [üî≤] Quiz Mode: Implement a quiz mode where users can test themselves with a timer or scoring system.
- [üî≤] Statistics Tracking: Track which cards the user struggles with the most and suggest them for review.

## Development Process

This project was developed using SwiftUI, which was my first time using this framework. The following concepts were integral to the app‚Äôs development:

- Flashcard Navigation: Implemented using SwiftUI's Gesture recognizers for swiping and tapping.
- State Management: Used SwiftUI‚Äôs @State to manage the deck‚Äôs state and flashcard progress.
- UI Design: Focused on simple, clean, and functional UI design to enhance the learning experience.

## Challenges Faced

- Learning SwiftUI: This was my first time working with SwiftUI, which introduced a learning curve in managing state and creating a dynamic user interface.
- State Reset: Implementing a feature to reset the deck and track the progress of individual cards was a bit tricky but ultimately rewarding.

## Key Takeaways

- Learned the basics of SwiftUI and its declarative syntax for creating user interfaces.
- Gained experience working with Gestures and State Management in SwiftUI.
- Improved skills in designing intuitive, interactive UIs that enhance user experience.

## Technologies Used
